#Arterys Challenge
**Model Overview:**

**Part 1** 
*Analysis*


Q: What is your test set error rate?

A: Test error rate: 1.54%

Q: What is the test set error rate for each class? Are some classes more challenging than others to distinguish from each other? Why? 


Q: Based only on information gathered in the first epoch of training, do you think that the model would benefit from more training time? Why?


Q: Besides training for a longer time, what would you do to improve accuracy?


**Part 2**
*Analysis on noisy data*


Q: What are the implications of the dependence of accuracy on noise if you were to deploy a production classifier? How much noise do you think a production classifier could tolerate?

Q: Do you think that Gaussian noise is an appropriate model for real-world noise if the characters were acquired by standard digital photography? If so, in what situations? How would you compensate for it?

Q: Is the accuracy of certain classes affected more by image noise than others? Why?


**Part 3**
*Analysis on noisy labels*


Q: How important are accurate training labels to classifier accuracy?

Q: How would you compensate for label noise? Assume you have a large budget available but you want to use it as efficiently as possible.


Q: How would you quantify the amount of label noise if you had a noisy data set?

Q: If your real-world data had both image noise and label noise, which would you be more concerned about? Which is easier to compensate for?
